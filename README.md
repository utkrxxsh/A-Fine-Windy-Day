Wind turbines generate power by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind. Factors such as temperature, wind direction, turbine status, weather, blade length, and so on influence the amount of power generated. This is a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the power that is generated (in KW/h) based on the various features provided in the dataset.
